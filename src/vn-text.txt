Congrats to the Baseball Team \Non Making Regional Semifinals
Hey, wanna play at my house today?
Huh, are you sure?
Yeah, come on over!
All right!
Huh?
This broom...
How come no one's using it?
Probably because it's the one I always use.
They say the curse spreads to \Nwhatever the Grim Reaper touches.
You shouldn't touch it either, \Nor else they'll say weird things about you.
Wait, what? That's amazing!
It's just like the magic spear Dark Dancer!
Huh? What's that?
It's an amazing weapon that \Ncurses whoever equips it!
I'm so jealous, Nishimura-san!
You can wield Dark Dancer!
Do you have any other cursed things?
I do...
I hear touching this will curse you, as well.
Wow! Just like the wicked Diabolus Bullet!
This, too.
Wow!
Just like Serpent, the magic sword \Nthat brings ruin upon its owner!
These, as well.
What?! It works on living things, too?!
You've got a ton of familiars!
You're amazing, Nishimura-san.
You've made so many cursed items.
You look like you're having fun, Takada-kun.
I sure am!
Every day is fun when I'm with you!
Is that right?
In fact, if you weren't here, \NI'd be really bummed.
What?
School wouldn't be any fun at all, y'know?
I need you here, Nishimura-san!
O-Okay.
I really mean it!
O-Okay already!

Episode 2 "Lunch Duty and Ghost Photographs and Love Letters"
Curry! Curry!
Curry! Curry!
I can't wait!
Yeah.
Ugh! The Grim Reaper's on lunch duty today?
I bet she'll curse the curry to taste bad.
Does it end up tasting bad \Nwhen you're on lunch duty?
You don't know, new kid?
Isn't it obvious?
I mean, the Grim Reaper wheeled \Nthat curry over here herself.
Oh, oh!
Kitagawa-kun, can I have \Nyour share of curry, then?
What?!
Well...
You don't want the curry \NNishimura-san brought, right?
Because it's cursed.
Th-That's right!
No one wants to eat curry \Nserved by the Grim Reaper!
I want to eat lots of Nishimura-san's curry!
I'll gobble up the curse, too,
and one day, I'll become\N a Dark Eater for sure!
What's a Dark Eater?
So if you don't want the curry \Nthat Nishimura-san made,
why can't I have it?
I never said I wouldn't eat it!
You can't have mine! Dummy!
What?!
I thought he was scared of the curse...
Kitagawa-kun sure is a weird one.
T-Takada-kun.
Um... thank you.
Huh? For what?
Milk
Who's in for rock-paper-scissors\N for the last milk?
Me!
Me!
Heck yeah! I'm gonna win for sure!
Looks like my time has come.
Oh, man! Let's hurry!
Wait. I don't need two cartons of milk.
This Month's Goal
Let's all get along!
All righty. I'm going for it! I won't lose!
Today's the day!
I was so close in milk \Nrock-paper-scissors...
T-Takada-kun, do you want my milk?
I can have it?!
Thanks!
My Clueless First Friend
Nishimura-san!
Wanna take photos together?
S-Sure, but that came out of nowhere.
The kids in class were talking about how \Na ghost shows up in pictures with you.
I'm pretty sure {\i0}I'm{\i1} the ghost\N they're talking about...
Hey, look.
Isn't there a ghost in this photo?
I think that's Nishimura-san.
She {\i1}does{\i0} look like one!
I'm gonna take it!
I'm gonna take it!
O-Okay.
I don't see any ghosts here.
I'm pretty sure it's there. \NRight next to you.
What?!
A-Amazing!
Does this mean you can see ghosts and stuff?!
N-No, I can't.
That's not what I meant.
Hey, Takada!
You don't get it at all.
Hino-kun?!
You think a real ghost's\N gonna show up for someone
having so much fun taking ghost pictures?
He's got a point.
Huh? You think so?
Hino-kun gets real invested \Nin the supernatural and tank tops.
That's a broad range of interests...
I'll control the shutter this time.
So no looking like you're having fun.
O-Okay.
We can't look like \Nwe're having any fun at all.
Absolutely none!
R-Right.
You ready?
Here we go!
Hey, Takada!
Takada-kun...
You look like you're having \Nthe time of your life.
That's weird.
I put on my serious face.
Maybe it's 'cause I'm with Nishimura-san.
Just being with her puts a smile on my face.
What's wrong?
It... It's nothing.
My Clueless First Friend
I'm home!
My little brother in fifth grade\N brought home a girl.
Um... Who's this, Taiyou?
How do you know each other? Well?
This is my classmate, Nishimura-san.
I'm proud to call her my closest friend!
E-Er...
When you say you're close, do you mean...
W-We're just normal friends!
Oh my, look at her turning red!
How adorable!
Nishimura-san, you can call me Yukiko.
Take good care of Taiyou!
We're really just normal friends!
There she goes blushing again!
C'mon, let's go and play video games!
S-Sure.
My, my, look at you \Ntaking her hand like that.
Pretty smooth, Taiyou.
It's amazing, Onee-chan!
If you hold hands with Nishimura-san, \Nit really feels like you're cursed!
How could you say that to a girl?!
What?!
But it's true! I can feel so \Nmuch power coming from her!
I'm pretty sure that's all \Nin your head, Takada-kun.
T-Taiyou!
Look! Nishimura-san's mad because \Nyou said something weird!
Huh? Why? What'd I say?
Take it back! Go on!
Whaaat?!
O-Onee-chan!
Th-This is my normal face.
Take it back already.
When I hold hands with Nishimura-san, \NI get really happy!
T-Taiyou!
Th-Thanks.
Sh-She's beet red!
How cute can you get? What an angel!

Are you sure?
Yes\NNo

Hey, hey!
This character looks like you.
Huh? Y-You think?
Yeah!
Taiyou...
Your big sister... really loves \Nwatching scenes like this play out.
My Clueless First Friend
Theme\NYour favorite word
Okay, get started!
Theme\NYour favorite word
What?
I really have no idea.
Hi-yah!
What should I pick?
Oh, not half bad!
And when you let your guard down...
Not happening!
Get him, get him!
I can't decide at all.
I feel like I'm gonna get this on my clothes.
Same.
Don't get your sleeves dirty.
{\an8}How should I write this?
We're supposed to pick our favorite word.
What're you gonna write?
Hmm, I think I'll go with "tank top."
Oh!
What about you?
I'm gonna use you, Nishimura-san!
C'mon, Kitagawa, Tanaka, Yamamoto.
Get to work already!
Would "Grim Reaper" look \Nthe coolest, you think?
We're sorry...
Wh-Why pick me?
Well, the awesome factor...
And you could say I'm infatuated.
You mean with my nickname, right?
I-I really don't think you \Nshould write "Grim Reaper."
Everyone in class will tease you.
What?!
Then what are you gonna write?
What's your favorite word?
Huh?
I... don't like dark and gloomy words \Nbecause they remind me of myself.
So I like words that are the total opposite.
Like "hikari" (light) or "taiyou" (sun)...
Oh.
Takada Taiyou
Ah... Er...
I, uh... U-Um...
You like sunshine?
Huh?
Yeah, that's it! I love sunshine!
I meant {\i1}that{\i0} "taiyou"!
I love sunshine, too!
It gets a little too hot in summer, though.
I-I agree.
It's real bad, you two. Help me out.
What's the matter?
I don't know how to write "tank top" in kanji.
Can't you just use katakana?

What?
Takada-kun caught a cold?
Yeah. He said he's too \Nsick to hang out today.
I see. I hope he's okay.
I've told him so many times \Nto keep his shoulders warm.
Aren't you the one who\N should be worried about that?
Anyway, let's go to Takada's \Nplace and pay him a visit.
Huh? I-Is it okay to visit \Nwithout any notice?
What if we end up disturbing him instead?
If you go visit him, \NI'm sure Takada would be thrilled.
Y-You think so?
Well, duh. We're talking about Takada here.
I'll be with you, so he'll be over the moon.
H-Hino-kun!
Y-Yeah, you're right...
You're best friends, after all.
Smirk.
A shockingly embarrassing \Nmisunderstanding on my part!
Coming!
Oh? What's this?
H-Hello there.
We're visiting the patient.
S-Sorry. We can leave if we're being a bother.
You're not bothering me at all!
I'm really glad you two came over.
Told ya.
Hino-kun!
My Clueless First Friend
Nanba
Nishimura
N-N-Nishimura-san!
N-Nishimura-san, wait, is that...
a love letter?!
Amazing, Nishimura-san!
I mean, you {\i1}are{\i0} the coolest!
This is just a prank.
Or a stupid punishment game.
You think someone wrote you \Na fake love letter as punishment?
Yeah.
Fake love letters \Nto the Grim Reaper to tease her.
The usual nonsense about curses.
I see!
Takada-kun, you don't really get it, do you?
Does this mean I can write \Nyou a love letter, as well?
Why?!
Let's go.
You're cursed, right?
I want you to curse me!
Sometimes, it feels like that's \Nall you hear, Takada-kun.
I'll write down tons of good things about you!
T-Tons?
A-Are there really that many?
Sure there are! I can name a bunch!
There's your cool gaze, for one.
Oh, and I can't leave out that \Nyou were willing to be my friend.
I... should be the one saying that.
Ah!
What do I do, Nishimura-san?!
Wh-What is it?
I-I don't think I can fit it all in a letter!
There are so many things I like about you!
Once I put it into words, \Ncan I say it out loud instead?
Out loud?!
H-He's really gonna say it.
I've got it all ready!
What?!
By the way, how was this a punishment?
I don't think it really applies to you.
I mean, you're unstoppable.
I'm unstoppable? That rules!
Does that mean I possess \NGrim Reaper powers now?!
You really are unstoppable...
My Clueless First Friend
Nishimura-san!
Ah.
Hello there, Yukiko-san.
Been doing some shopping there?
At a bookstore, by the look of it.
Y-Yes, there were some \Nbooks I wanted to get.
Do you like reading?
As much as anyone else.
I see, I see.
I know! Are you free to come over?
Huh?
My brother's out for his lessons, though.
What?
U-Um...
Mm-hmm, you look adorbs in that.
I-I can't accept these clothes.
It's fine! They're just my old hand-me-downs.
If you won't take them, I'll just make \Nmy little brother wear 'em instead.
Whoo!
T-Takada-kun, in these?
They look so good on you!
You're so cute!
This angle's great, too!
C'mon, give me a smile!
You look adorable!
But if I wear clothes that are too cutesy,
everyone in my class will laugh at me.
Why's that? You look great in them.
I-I mean...
everyone calls me the Grim Reaper.
And, well...
That's a cool nickname.
But what's it got to do with how you dress?
You should wear what you want \Ninstead of worrying about it.
And if they're mean about it,
you can just have my brother save the day.
But then I'd be causing \Ntrouble for Takada-kun...
It's fine. He's the one \Nwho enjoys it the most.
Besides, Taiyou never shuts up \Nabout you even at home.
Wha... Wha...
And whenever he's talking \Nabout you, he looks so happy.
Honest truth.
Th-Thank you so much!
You really are cute in that.
I want to show Taiyou as soon as possible.
You're just the cutest thing.
My Clueless First Friend
A bad luck aura?
It's another one of Nishimura's curses.
You get bad luck when \Nyou hang out with the Grim Reaper.
A bad luck aura... That sounds so cool.
That reminds me! Hino-kun said he's \Ninto superstitions like that.
Does that mean you're into tank tops, too?
Where'd that come from?!
Whatever! You keep hanging out with that\N creeper Grim Reaper, and you're in for it!
Because of Nishimura-san's curse?
That's right!
So come join us instead.
Leave the Grim Reaper in the dust.
But being with Nishimura-san is fun.
Only because you haven't noticed yet.
Your luck is slowly getting worse\N because of her curse.
That's how the aura works.
Wow...
This means Nishimura-san is making me\Nso happy that it's offsetting my bad luck.
I-I didn't say anything like that, new kid!
How else can you explain why I have \Nso much fun with Nishimura-san?
I'd better thank her!
See ya!
Hey, what do you think, Kitagawa-kun?
Don't ask me! Scram already!
Hello. Nishimura speaking.
Yes. Yes. From her class?
Akane!
T-Takada-kun?
Why are you calling so late at night?
There's something I need to tell you.
Huh? What is it?
Nishimura-san...
Thanks for always making me so happy!
What?!
Next time, I'll be the \None to make you happy!
Wh-What's this all about?!
Well, see you tomorrow!
That was so much fun, we ended up \Ntalking for two whole hours.
It sure was embarrassing\N to say thank you like that.
That's not the part that \Nshould embarrass you.
Didn't I tell you to keep \Nyour shoulders warm?
Ah, I'm all better now!
Really?
Whoa! It's so white!
Good morning.
You're not Nishimura-san!\NNow you're Whitemura-san!
Gee wowzers!
I-I thought white would \Nbe a nice change of pace.
I got a lot of clothes from your big sister.
Wow.
Does white look weird on me?
Not at all! You wear it well!
White looks really good on you!
Th-Thanks.
Sorry, I can't tell the difference.
It's all sleeves to me.
What's so funny?
Just that Nishimura-san's \Ntrying pretty hard for once.
Even though she's still the Grim Reaper,\N no matter how cute her clothes.
Ooh, you mean she's still strong \Neven though she looks this cute?
That's way too awesome!
H-How'd you come to that conclusion?
Well, based on what you said,
Nishimura-san's Grim Reaper powers don't wane,\N no matter what she's wearing.
That rocks!
Nishimura-san really {\i1}is{\i0} the coolest.
I'm impressed, Kasahara-san.
What do you mean?
When I saw Nishimura-san just now, \Nall I could think is "Wow, she's cute!"
What?
Oh! I don't mean that black \Ndoesn't look good on you!
It's way high on the coolness scale,\Nand white ranks on the cuteness scale.
I-I get it already!
Next time...
